Revision history for Scope-Upper

0.06    2009-01-17 00:05 UTC
        + Chg : INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The level is now absolute and no longer
                relative to the current frame - we'll call it "context" from now
                on. You should replace all your raw levels by combinations of
                words.
                The old behaviour of "=> $n" can be easily reobtained by using
                "=> SCOPE($n)".
        + Fix : As a result of this change, the module now plays nicely with
                the debugger.

0.05    2009-01-12 18:15 UTC
        + Fix : Stack mess when using unwind() in scalar context.
        + Fix : Returning an automatic variable isn't wise, so let's use a
                context instead.
        + Doc : Clarifications.
        + Tst : Stress tests for unwind().

0.04    2009-01-11 18:40 UTC
        + Add : unwind(@things, $level), that returns to an upper context.
        + Add : want_at($level), that gives the wantarray for $level.
        + Add : Control words, to reliably get the level of the n-th upper
                subroutine or eval scope. TOPLEVEL was renamed to TOP.
        + Fix : Tests with 5.6.
        + Tst : Reordering and factoring some of the stress tests so that they
                aren't needlessly ran several times.

0.03    2009-01-04 15:55 UTC
        + Add : localize_delete(), that localize array/hash elements in upper
                scopes.
        + Fix : Segfault when localizing array elements with an invalid negative
                index.

0.02    2008-12-28 18:40 UTC
        + Doc : Clarifications and improvements.
        + Fix : Missing compatibility macros.
        + Fix : Localized nonexistant array elements should be deleted when
                their time comes so that the array recovers its original length.
