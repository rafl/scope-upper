=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module lets you defer actions that will take place when the control flow returns into an upper scope.
Currently, you can hook an upper scope end, or localize variables, array/hash values or deletions of elements in higher contexts.
You can also return to an upper level and know which context was in use then.

=head1 WORDS

These control words are to be used to indicate the target scope.

=head2 C<TOP>

Returns the level that currently represents the highest scope.

=head2 C<HERE>

The current level.

=head2 C<UP $from>

The level of the scope just above C<$from>.

=head2 C<SUB $from>

The level of the closest subroutine context above C<$from>.

=head2 C<EVAL $from>

The level of the closest eval context above C<$from>.

If C<$from> is omitted in any of those functions, the current level is used as the reference level.

=head2 C<CALLER $stack>

The level of the C<$stack>-th upper subroutine/eval/format context.
It kind of corresponds to the context represented by C<caller $stack>, but while e.g. C<caller 0> refers to the caller context, C<CALLER 0> will refer to the top scope in the current context.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=cut

BEGIN {
 require XSLoader;
 XSLoader::load(__PACKAGE__, $VERSION);
}

=head2 C<reap $callback, $level>

Add a destructor that calls C<$callback> when the C<$level>-th upper scope ends, where C<0> corresponds to the current scope.

=head2 C<localize $what, $value, $level>

A C<local> delayed to the time of first return into the C<$level>-th upper scope.
C<$what> can be :

=over 4

=item *

A glob, in which case C<$value> can either be a glob or a reference.
L</localize> follows then the same syntax as C<local *x = $value>.
For example, if C<$value> is a scalar reference, then the C<SCALAR> slot of the glob will be set to C<$$value> - just like C<local *x = \1> sets C<$x> to C<1>.

=item *

A string beginning with a sigil, representing the symbol to localize and to assign to.
If the sigil is C<'$'>, L</localize> follows the same syntax as C<local $x = $value>, i.e. C<$value> isn't dereferenced.
For example,

    localize '$x', \'foo' => HERE;

will set C<$x> to a reference to the string C<'foo'>.
Other sigils (C<'@'>, C<'%'>, C<'&'> and C<'*'>) require C<$value> to be a reference of the corresponding type.

When the symbol is given by a string, it is resolved when the actual localization takes place and not when C<localize> is called.
This means that

    sub tag { localize '$x', $_[0] => UP }

will localize in the caller's namespace.

=back

=head2 C<localize_elem $what, $key, $value, $level>

Similar to L</localize> but for array and hash elements.
If C<$what> is a glob, the slot to fill is determined from which type of reference C<$value> is ; otherwise it's inferred from the sigil.
C<$key> is either an array index or a hash key, depending of which kind of variable you localize.

=head2 C<localize_delete $what, $key, $level>

Similiar to L</localize>, but for deleting variables or array/hash elements.
C<$what> can be:

=over 4

=item *

A glob, in which case C<$key> is ignored and the call is equivalent to C<local *x>.

=item *

A string beginning with C<'@'> or C<'%'>, for which the call is equivalent to respectiveley C<local $a[$key]; delete $a[$key]> and C<local $h{$key}; delete $h{$key}>.

=item *

A string beginning with C<'&'>, which more or less does C<undef &func> in the upper scope.
It's actually more powerful, as C<&func> won't even C<exists> anymore.
C<$key> is ignored.

=back

=head2 C<unwind @values, $level>

Returns C<@values> I<from> the context indicated by C<$level>, i.e. from the subroutine, eval or format just above C<$level>.

The upper level isn't coerced onto C<@values>, which is hence always evaluated in list context.
This means that

    my $num = sub {
     my @a = ('a' .. 'z');
     unwind @a => HERE;
    }->();

will set C<$num> to C<'z'>.
You can use L</want_at> to handle these cases.

=head2 C<want_at $level>

Like C<wantarray>, but for the subroutine/eval/format context just above C<$level>.

The previous example can then be "corrected" :

    my $num = sub {
     my @a = ('a' .. 'z');
     unwind +(want_at(HERE) ? @a : scalar @a) => HERE;
    }->();

will righteously set C<$num> to C<26>.

=head1 EXPORT

The functions L</reap>, L</localize>, L</localize_elem>, L</localize_delete>,  L</unwind> and L</want_at> are only exported on request, either individually or by the tags C<':funcs'> and C<':all'>.

Same goes for the words L</TOP>, L</HERE>, L</UP>, L</SUB>, L</EVAL> and L</CALLER> that are only exported on request, individually or by the tags C<':words'> and C<':all'>.

=cut

use base qw/Exporter/;

our @EXPORT      = ();
our %EXPORT_TAGS = (
 funcs => [ qw/reap localize localize_elem localize_delete unwind want_at/ ],
 words => [ qw/TOP HERE UP SUB EVAL CALLER/ ],
);
our @EXPORT_OK   = map { @$_ } values %EXPORT_TAGS;
$EXPORT_TAGS{'all'} = [ @EXPORT_OK ];

=head1 CAVEATS

Be careful that local variables are restored in the reverse order in which they were localized.
Consider those examples:

    local $x = 0;
    {
     reap sub { print $x } => HERE;
     local $x = 1;
     ...
    }
    # prints '0'
    ...
    {
     local $x = 1;
     reap sub { $x = 2 } => HERE;
     ...
    }
    # $x is 0

The first case is "solved" by moving the C<local> before the C<reap>, and the second by using L</localize> instead of L</reap>.

L</reap>, L</localize> and L</localize_elem> effects can't cross C<BEGIN> blocks, hence calling those functions in C<import> is deemed to be useless.
This is an hopeless case because C<BEGIN> blocks are executed once while localizing constructs should do their job at each run.
