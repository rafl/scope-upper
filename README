DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you defer actions that will take place when the control
    flow returns into an upper scope. Currently, you can hook an upper scope
    end, or localize variables, array/hash values or deletions of elements
    in higher contexts. You can also return to an upper level and know which
    context was in use then.

FUNCTIONS
    In all those functions, $context refers to the target scope.

    You have to use one or a combination of "WORDS" to build the $context to
    pass to these functions. This is needed in order to ensure that the
    module still works when your program is ran in the debugger. Don't try
    to use a raw value or things will get messy.

    The only thing you can assume is that it is an *absolute* indicator of
    the frame. This means that you can safely store it at some point and use
    it when needed, and it will still denote the original scope.

  "reap $callback, $context"
    Add a destructor that calls $callback when the upper scope represented
    by $context ends.

  "localize $what, $value, $context"
    A "local" delayed to the time of first return into the upper scope
    denoted by $context. $what can be :

    *   A glob, in which case $value can either be a glob or a reference.
        "localize" follows then the same syntax as "local *x = $value". For
        example, if $value is a scalar reference, then the "SCALAR" slot of
        the glob will be set to $$value - just like "local *x = \1" sets $x
        to 1.

    *   A string beginning with a sigil, representing the symbol to localize
        and to assign to. If the sigil is '$', "localize" follows the same
        syntax as "local $x = $value", i.e. $value isn't dereferenced. For
        example,

            localize '$x', \'foo' => HERE;

        will set $x to a reference to the string 'foo'. Other sigils ('@',
        '%', '&' and '*') require $value to be a reference of the
        corresponding type.

        When the symbol is given by a string, it is resolved when the actual
        localization takes place and not when "localize" is called. This
        means that

            sub tag { localize '$x', $_[0] => UP }

        will localize in the caller's namespace.

  "localize_elem $what, $key, $value, $context"
    Similar to "localize" but for array and hash elements. If $what is a
    glob, the slot to fill is determined from which type of reference $value
    is ; otherwise it's inferred from the sigil. $key is either an array
    index or a hash key, depending of which kind of variable you localize.

  "localize_delete $what, $key, $context"
    Similiar to "localize", but for deleting variables or array/hash
    elements. $what can be:

    *   A glob, in which case $key is ignored and the call is equivalent to
        "local *x".

    *   A string beginning with '@' or '%', for which the call is equivalent
        to respectiveley "local $a[$key]; delete $a[$key]" and "local
        $h{$key}; delete $h{$key}".

    *   A string beginning with '&', which more or less does "undef &func"
        in the upper scope. It's actually more powerful, as &func won't even
        "exists" anymore. $key is ignored.

  "unwind @values, $context"
    Returns @values *from* the context pointed by $context, i.e. from the
    subroutine, eval or format just above $context.

    The upper context isn't coerced onto @values, which is hence always
    evaluated in list context. This means that

        my $num = sub {
         my @a = ('a' .. 'z');
         unwind @a => HERE;
        }->();

    will set $num to 'z'. You can use "want_at" to handle these cases.

  "want_at $context"
    Like "wantarray", but for the subroutine/eval/format just above
    $context.

    The previous example can then be "corrected" :

        my $num = sub {
         my @a = ('a' .. 'z');
         unwind +(want_at(HERE) ? @a : scalar @a) => HERE;
        }->();

    will righteously set $num to 26.

WORDS
  Constants
   "TOP"
    Returns the context that currently represents the highest scope.

   "HERE"
    The context of the current scope.

  Getting a context from a context
    For any of those functions, $from is expected to be a context. When
    omitted, it defaults to the the current context.

   "UP $from"
    The context of the scope just above $from.

   "SUB $from"
    The context of the closest subroutine above $from.

   "EVAL $from"
    The context of the closest eval above $from.

  Getting a context from a level
    Here, $level should denote a number of scopes above the current one.
    When omitted, it defaults to 0 and those functions return the same
    context as "HERE".

   "SCOPE $level"
    The $level-th upper context, regardless of its type.

   "CALLER $level"
    The context of the $level-th upper subroutine/eval/format. It kind of
    corresponds to the context represented by "caller $level", but while
    e.g. "caller 0" refers to the caller context, "CALLER 0" will refer to
    the top scope in the current context.

EXPORT
    The functions "reap", "localize", "localize_elem", "localize_delete",
    "unwind" and "want_at" are only exported on request, either individually
    or by the tags ':funcs' and ':all'.

    Same goes for the words "TOP", "HERE", "UP", "SUB", "EVAL", "SCOPE" and
    "CALLER" that are only exported on request, individually or by the tags
    ':words' and ':all'.

CAVEATS
    Be careful that local variables are restored in the reverse order in
    which they were localized. Consider those examples:

        local $x = 0;
        {
         reap sub { print $x } => HERE;
         local $x = 1;
         ...
        }
        # prints '0'
        ...
        {
         local $x = 1;
         reap sub { $x = 2 } => HERE;
         ...
        }
        # $x is 0

    The first case is "solved" by moving the "local" before the "reap", and
    the second by using "localize" instead of "reap".

    "reap", "localize" and "localize_elem" effects can't cross "BEGIN"
    blocks, hence calling those functions in "import" is deemed to be
    useless. This is an hopeless case because "BEGIN" blocks are executed
    once while localizing constructs should do their job at each run.

    Some rare oddities may still happen when running inside the debugger. It
    may help to use a perl higher than 5.8.9 or 5.10.0, as they contain some
    context fixes.
